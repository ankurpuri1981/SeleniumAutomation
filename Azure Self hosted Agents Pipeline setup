There should be a file named x64.complete in D:\vsts-agent-win-x64-2.179.0\_work\_tool\Python\3.9.0\
You should install python in the VM and also add below paths in the path environment variable-

Most important is to configure azure pilepine agent, there choose run it as a user, logged into your VM.

Install chrome and python on the VM.
